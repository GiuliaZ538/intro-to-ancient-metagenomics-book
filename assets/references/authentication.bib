  abstract = {Analysis of microbial data from archaeological samples is a
              rapidly growing field with a great potential for understanding
              ancient environments, lifestyles and disease spread in the past.
              However, high error rates have been a long-standing challenge in
              ancient metagenomics analysis. This is also complicated by a
              limited choice of ancient microbiome specific computational
              frameworks that meet the growing computational demands of the
              field. Here, we propose aMeta, an accurate ancient Metagenomic
              profiling workflow designed primarily to minimize the amount of
              false discoveries and computer memory requirements. Using
              simulated ancient metagenomic samples, we benchmark aMeta against
              a current state-of-the-art workflow, and demonstrate its superior
              sensitivity and specificity in both microbial detection and
              authentication, as well as substantially lower usage of computer
              memory. aMeta is implemented as a Snakemake workflow to facilitate
              use and reproducibility. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

	abstract = {Central European forests have been shaped by complex human interactions throughout the Holocene, with significant changes following the introduction of domesticated animals in the Neolithic (\~{}7.5 {\textendash} 6.0 kyr BP). However, understanding early pastoral practices and their impact on forests is limited by methods for detecting animal movement across past landscapes. Here we examine ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) preserved at the Velk{\'y} Mamu{\v t}{\'a}k rock shelter, in northern Bohemia (Czech Republic), which has been a forested enclave since the early Holocene. We find that domesticated animals, their associated microbiomes, and plants potentially gathered for fodder, have clear representation by the Late Neolithic, around 6.0 kyr BP, and persist throughout the Bronze Age into recent times. We identify a change in dominant grazing species from sheep to pigs in the Bronze Age (\~{}4.1 {\textendash} 3.0 kyr BP) and interpret the impact this had in the mid-Holocene retrogressions that still define the structure of Central European forests today. This study highlights the ability of ancient metagenomics to bridge archaeological and paleoecological methods and provide an enhanced perspective on the roots of the Anthropocene.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
