  abstract = "Modern strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the Americas are
              closely related to those from Europe, supporting the assumption
              that human tuberculosis was introduced post-contact. This notion,
              however, is incompatible with archaeological evidence of
              pre-contact tuberculosis in the New World. Comparative genomics of
              modern isolates suggests that M. tuberculosis attained its
              worldwide distribution following human dispersals out of Africa
              during the Pleistocene epoch, although this has yet to be
              confirmed with ancient calibration points. Here we present three
              1,000-year-old mycobacterial genomes from Peruvian human
              skeletons, revealing that a member of the M. tuberculosis complex
              caused human disease before contact. The ancient strains are
              distinct from known human-adapted forms and are most closely
              related to those adapted to seals and sea lions. Two independent
              dating approaches suggest a most recent common ancestor for the M.
              tuberculosis complex less than 6,000 years ago, which supports a
              Holocene dispersal of the disease. Our results implicate sea
              mammals as having played a role in transmitting the disease to
              humans across the ocean.",
