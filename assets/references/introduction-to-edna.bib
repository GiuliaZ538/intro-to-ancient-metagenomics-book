               change. In particular, the study of microbial ancient DNA
               preserved in sediment archives from lakes and oceans can help us
               to evaluate the responses of aquatic microbes in the past and
               make predictions about future biodiversity change in those
               ecosystems. Recent advances in molecular genetic methods applied
               to the analysis of historically deposited DNA in sediments have
               not only allowed the taxonomic identification of past aquatic
               microbial communities but also enabled tracing their evolution
               and adaptation to episodic disturbances and gradual environmental
               change. Nevertheless, some challenges remain for scientists to
               take full advantage of the rapidly developing field of
               paleo-genetics, including the limited ability to detect rare taxa

               challenges related to the application of molecular genetic
               methods to study microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution in

               historically relied on morphological identification of macro- and
               microfossils from sediments of small freshwater lakes. Here, we
               report new protocols that reliably yield DNA sequence data from
               Holocene plant macrofossils and bulk lake sediment used to infer
               ecological change. This will allow changes in census populations,
               estimated from fossils and associated sediment, to be directly
               associated with population genetic changes. RESULTS: We
               successfully sequenced DNA from 64 samples (out of 126) comprised
               of bulk sediment and seeds, leaf fragments, budscales, and
               samaras extracted from Holocene lake sediments in the western
               Great Lakes region of North America. Overall, DNA yields were
               low. However, we were able to reliably amplify samples with as
               few as 10 copies of a short cpDNA fragment with little detectable
               PCR inhibition. Our success rate was highest for sediments < 2000
               years old, but we were able to successfully amplify DNA from
               samples up to 4600 years old. DNA sequences matched the taxonomic
               identity of the macrofossil from which they were extracted 79\%
               of the time. Exceptions suggest that DNA molecules from
               surrounding nearby sediments may permeate or adhere to
               macrofossils in sediments. CONCLUSIONS: An ability to extract
               ancient DNA from Holocene sediments potentially allows exciting
               new insights into the genetic consequences of long-term
               environmental change. The low DNA copy numbers we found in fossil
               material and the discovery of multiple sequence variants from
               single macrofossil extractions highlight the need for careful
               experimental and laboratory protocols. Further application of
               these protocols should lead to better understanding of the
               ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change.},

               years ago1 had climates resembling those forecasted under future
               warming2. Palaeoclimatic records show strong polar amplification
               with mean annual temperatures of 11-19 °C above contemporary
               values3,4. The biological communities inhabiting the Arctic
               during this time remain poorly known because fossils are rare5.
               Here we report an ancient environmental DNA6 (eDNA) record
               describing the rich plant and animal assemblages of the Kap
               København Formation in North Greenland, dated to around two
               million years ago. The record shows an open boreal forest
               ecosystem with mixed vegetation of poplar, birch and thuja trees,
               as well as a variety of Arctic and boreal shrubs and herbs, many
               of which had not previously been detected at the site from
               macrofossil and pollen records. The DNA record confirms the
               presence of hare and mitochondrial DNA from animals including
               mastodons, reindeer, rodents and geese, all ancestral to their
               present-day and late Pleistocene relatives. The presence of
               marine species including horseshoe crab and green algae support a
               warmer climate than today. The reconstructed ecosystem has no
               modern analogue. The survival of such ancient eDNA probably
               relates to its binding to mineral surfaces. Our findings open new
               areas of genetic research, demonstrating that it is possible to
               track the ecology and evolution of biological communities from
               two million years ago using ancient eDNA.},

               organic matter and are ubiquitous in most environments. Such DNA
               becomes fragmented and damaged (often <100 bp) and may persist in
               the environment for more than half a million years. Fragmented
               DNA is recognized as nutrient source for microbes, but not as
               potential substrate for bacterial evolution. Here, we show that
               fragmented DNA molecules (≥ 20 bp) that additionally may contain
               abasic sites, cross-links, or miscoding lesions are acquired by
               the environmental bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi through natural
               transformation. With uptake of DNA from a 43,000-y-old woolly
               mammoth bone, we further demonstrate that such natural
               transformation events include ancient DNA molecules. We find that
               the DNA recombination is RecA recombinase independent and is
               directly linked to DNA replication. We show that the adjacent

               appear more common among genomes of transformable than
               nontransformable bacteria. Our findings reveal that short and
               damaged, including truly ancient, DNA molecules, which are
               present in large quantities in the environment, can be acquired
               by bacteria through natural transformation. Our findings open for

               at archaeological sites. PalEnDNA analysis provides a relatively
               new tool for Quaternary and archaeological sciences and its
               applications have included palaeoenvironmental and palaeodietary

               extinctions, human–environment interactions, taxonomic studies,
               and studies of DNA damage. Because PalEnDNA samples comprise
               markedly different materials, and represent wide‐ranging
               depositional and taphonomic contexts, various issues must be
               addressed to achieve robust, reproducible findings. Such issues

              resource for the study of past hominin and environmental
              diversity. However, little is known about how DNA is preserved in
              sediments and the extent to which it may be translocated between
              archaeological strata. Here, we investigate DNA preservation in 47
              blocks of resin-impregnated archaeological sediment collected over
              the last four decades for micromorphological analyses at 13
              prehistoric sites in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America and
              show that such blocks can preserve DNA of hominins and other
              mammals. Extensive microsampling of sediment blocks from Denisova
              Cave in the Altai Mountains reveals that the taxonomic composition
              of mammalian DNA differs drastically at the millimeter-scale and
              that DNA is concentrated in small particles, especially in
              fragments of bone and feces (coprolites), suggesting that these
              are substantial sources of DNA in sediments. Three microsamples
              taken in close proximity in one of the blocks yielded Neanderthal
              DNA from at least two male individuals closely related to Denisova
              5, a Neanderthal toe bone previously recovered from the same
              layer. Our work indicates that DNA can remain stably localized in
              sediments over time and provides a means of linking genetic

              extraction of ancient DNA (aDNA) from both frozen and nonfrozen
              sediments (even in the absence of macrofossils) in order to obtain
              genetic ``profiles'' from past environments. One of the hazards
              associated with this approach, particularly in nonfrozen
              environments, is the potential for vertical migration of aDNA
              across strata. To assess the extent of this problem, we extracted
              aDNA from sediments up to 3300 years old at 2 cave sites in the
              North Island of New Zealand. These sites are ideal for this
              purpose as the presence or absence of DNA from nonindigenous fauna
              (such as sheep) in sediments deposited prior to European
              settlement can serve as an indicator of DNA movement.
              Additionally, these strata are well defined and dated. DNA from
              sheep was found in strata that also contained moa DNA, indicating
              that genetic material had migrated downwards. Quantitative
              polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that the amount of
              sheep DNA decreased as the age of sediments increased. Our results
              suggest that sedimentary aDNA is unlikely to be deposited from
              wind-borne DNA and that physical remains of organisms or their

  abstract = {The Paisley Caves in Oregon record the oldest directly dated human
              remains (DNA) in the Western Hemisphere. More than 100
              high-precision radiocarbon dates show that deposits containing
              artifacts and coprolites ranging in age from 12,450 to 2295 (14)C
              years ago are well stratified. Western Stemmed projectile points
              were recovered in deposits dated to 11,070 to 11,340 (14)C years
              ago, a time contemporaneous with or preceding the Clovis
              technology. There is no evidence of diagnostic Clovis technology
              at the site. These two distinct technologies were parallel
              developments, not the product of a unilinear technological
              evolution. ``Blind testing'' analysis of coprolites by an
              independent laboratory confirms the presence of human DNA in
              specimens of pre-Clovis age. The colonization of the Americas
              involved multiple technologically divergent, and possibly
              genetically divergent, founding groups.},
