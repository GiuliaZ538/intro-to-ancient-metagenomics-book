               understanding of ecological and evolutionary responses to global
               change. In particular, the study of microbial ancient DNA
               preserved in sediment archives from lakes and oceans can help us
               to evaluate the responses of aquatic microbes in the past and
               make predictions about future biodiversity change in those
               ecosystems. Recent advances in molecular genetic methods applied
               to the analysis of historically deposited DNA in sediments have
               not only allowed the taxonomic identification of past aquatic
               microbial communities but also enabled tracing their evolution
               and adaptation to episodic disturbances and gradual environmental
               change. Nevertheless, some challenges remain for scientists to
               take full advantage of the rapidly developing field of
               paleo-genetics, including the limited ability to detect rare taxa
               and reconstruct complete genomes for evolutionary studies. Here,

               challenges related to the application of molecular genetic
               methods to study microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution in

               responses to quaternary environmental changes at an unprecedented

               historically relied on morphological identification of macro- and
               microfossils from sediments of small freshwater lakes. Here, we
               report new protocols that reliably yield DNA sequence data from
               Holocene plant macrofossils and bulk lake sediment used to infer
               ecological change. This will allow changes in census populations,
               estimated from fossils and associated sediment, to be directly
               associated with population genetic changes. RESULTS: We
               successfully sequenced DNA from 64 samples (out of 126) comprised
               of bulk sediment and seeds, leaf fragments, budscales, and
               samaras extracted from Holocene lake sediments in the western
               Great Lakes region of North America. Overall, DNA yields were
               low. However, we were able to reliably amplify samples with as
               few as 10 copies of a short cpDNA fragment with little detectable
               PCR inhibition. Our success rate was highest for sediments < 2000
               years old, but we were able to successfully amplify DNA from
               samples up to 4600 years old. DNA sequences matched the taxonomic
               identity of the macrofossil from which they were extracted 79\%
               of the time. Exceptions suggest that DNA molecules from
               surrounding nearby sediments may permeate or adhere to
               macrofossils in sediments. CONCLUSIONS: An ability to extract
               ancient DNA from Holocene sediments potentially allows exciting
               new insights into the genetic consequences of long-term
               environmental change. The low DNA copy numbers we found in fossil
               material and the discovery of multiple sequence variants from
               single macrofossil extractions highlight the need for careful
               experimental and laboratory protocols. Further application of
               these protocols should lead to better understanding of the
               ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change.},

  abstract  = {SummaryThe panoply of microorganisms and other species present in
               our environment influence human health and disease, especially in
               cities, but have not been profiled with metagenomics at a
               city-wide scale. We sequenced DNA from surfaces across the entire
               New York City (NYC) subway system, the Gowanus Canal, and public
               parks. Nearly half of the DNA (48\%) does not match any known
               organism; identified organisms spanned 1,688 bacterial, viral,
               archaeal, and eukaryotic taxa, which were enriched for genera
               associated with skin (e.g., Acinetobacter). Predicted ancestry of
               human DNA left on subway surfaces can recapitulate U.S. Census
               demographic data, and bacterial signatures can match a station's
               history, such as marine-associated bacteria in a
               hurricane-flooded station. This baseline metagenomic map of NYC
               could help long-term disease surveillance, bioterrorism threat
               mitigation, and health management in the built environment of
               cities.},

  abstract  = {Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene epochs 3.6 to 0.8 million
               years ago1 had climates resembling those forecasted under future
               warming2. Palaeoclimatic records show strong polar amplification
               with mean annual temperatures of 11-19 °C above contemporary
               values3,4. The biological communities inhabiting the Arctic
               during this time remain poorly known because fossils are rare5.
               Here we report an ancient environmental DNA6 (eDNA) record
               describing the rich plant and animal assemblages of the Kap
               København Formation in North Greenland, dated to around two
               million years ago. The record shows an open boreal forest
               ecosystem with mixed vegetation of poplar, birch and thuja trees,
               as well as a variety of Arctic and boreal shrubs and herbs, many
               of which had not previously been detected at the site from
               macrofossil and pollen records. The DNA record confirms the
               presence of hare and mitochondrial DNA from animals including
               mastodons, reindeer, rodents and geese, all ancestral to their
               present-day and late Pleistocene relatives. The presence of
               marine species including horseshoe crab and green algae support a
               warmer climate than today. The reconstructed ecosystem has no
               modern analogue. The survival of such ancient eDNA probably
               relates to its binding to mineral surfaces. Our findings open new
               areas of genetic research, demonstrating that it is possible to
               track the ecology and evolution of biological communities from
               two million years ago using ancient eDNA.},
