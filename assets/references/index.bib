  abstract  = {The advancement of DNA/RNA, proteins, and metabolite analytical
               platforms, combined with increased computing technologies, has
               transformed the field of microbial community analysis. This
               transformation is evident by the exponential increase in the
               number of publications describing the composition and structure,
               and sometimes function, of the microbial communities inhabiting
               the human body. This rapid evolution of the field has been
               accompanied by confusion in the vocabulary used to describe
               different aspects of these communities and their environments.
               The misuse of terms such as microbiome, microbiota, metabolomic,
               and metagenome and metagenomics among others has contributed to
               misunderstanding of many study results by the scientific
               community and the general public alike. A few review articles
               have previously defined those terms, but mainly as sidebars, and
               no clear definitions or use cases have been published. In this
               editorial, we aim to propose clear definitions of each of these
               terms, which we would implore scientists in the field to adopt
               and perfect.},
