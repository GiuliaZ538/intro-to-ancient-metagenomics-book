              expected from fresh muscle, and that the DNA was of relatively
              low molecular weight. Among the many clones obtained from the
              quagga DNA, two containing pieces of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
              were sequenced. These sequences, comprising 229 nucleotide pairs,
              differ by 12 base substitutions from the corresponding sequences
              of mtDNA from a mountain zebra, an extant member of the genus
              Equus. The number, nature and locations of the substitutions

               mineralized form of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that

               calcification of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that forms
               naturally on the surface of teeth. Dental calculus is ubiquitous
               in the archaeological record, found in all areas of the world
               and in populations from all time periods. Because multiple types
               of biomolecules and micro-remains are preserved over long time
               periods in dental calculus, studies of dental calculus have many
               different applications. This chapter discusses how studies of
               dental calculus have been used to investigate the oral
               microbiome, the host, diet, and craft activities in the past. In
               addition to genetic studies of the oral microbiome, proteins and

              Comparative genomics of modern isolates suggests that M.

              recorded and most stigmatizing diseases in human history. The
              disease was prevalent in Europe until the 16th century and is
              still endemic in many countries with over 200,000 new cases

              European medieval M. leprae genomes revealed that they cluster
              into several distinct branches of which two were present in
              medieval Northwestern Europe. In this study, we analyzed 10 new
              medieval M. leprae genomes including the so far oldest M. leprae
              genome from one of the earliest known cases of leprosy in the
              United Kingdom-a skeleton from the Great Chesterford cemetery
              with a calibrated age of 415-545 C.E. This dataset provides a
              genetic time transect of M. leprae diversity in Europe over the
              past 1500 years. We find M. leprae strains from four distinct

              even an origin in Western Eurasia. Furthermore, these results

               investigating past marine ecosystems---from the smallest
               bacteria to phytoplankton and their predators--- over geological
               timescales. Knowledge about such paleo-food webs can provide
               broad-scale biological context to paleoceanographic and
               environmental reconstructions. However, the field of marine
               sedaDNA research is still in its infancy; community
               reconstructions are complicated by the minuscule amounts of
               ancient DNA preserved in the sediments. Consequently, the
               identification of most prokaryotes and eukaryotes in sedaDNA is
               difficult, and sedaDNA sampling, extraction, and analysis
               require optimized procedures and rigorous contamination control
               to ensure that the sedaDNA signal is authentic and not
               overridden by modern environmental DNA. This article describes
               some of the latest developments in marine sedaDNA research,

              with likely dormant methanogens from the permafrost's seed bank.
              Our findings reveal that at the time of the formation, the
              terrestrial input of the Kap K{\o}benhavn site originated from a
              palustrine wetland, suggesting non-permafrost conditions. During

              proportion of the Earth's microbial biomass. Our understanding
              about terrestrial subsurface microbiomes is almost exclusively
              derived from groundwater and porous sediments mainly by using 16S
              rRNA gene surveys. To obtain more insights about biomass of
              consolidated rocks and the metabolic status of endolithic
              microbiomes, we investigated interbedded limestone and mudstone
              from the vadose zone, fractured aquifers, and deep aquitards.
              RESULTS: By adapting methods from microbial archaeology and
              paleogenomics, we could recover sufficient DNA for downstream
              metagenomic analysis from seven rock specimens independent of
              porosity, lithology, and depth. Based on the extracted DNA, we
              estimated between 2.81 and 4.25 $\times$ 105 cells $\times$ g-1
              rock. Analyzing DNA damage patterns revealed paleome signatures
              (genetic records of past microbial communities) for three rock
              specimens, all obtained from the vadose zone. DNA obtained from
              deep aquitards isolated from surface input was not affected by
              DNA decay indicating that water saturation and not flow is
              controlling subsurface microbial survival. Decoding the taxonomy
              and functional potential of paleome communities revealed
              increased abundances for sequences affiliated with
              chemolithoautotrophs and taxa such as Cand. Rokubacteria. We also
              found a broader metabolic potential in terms of aromatic
              hydrocarbon breakdown, suggesting a preferred utilization of
              sedimentary organic matter in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
              suggests that limestones function as archives for genetic records

              environmental stress at modern times, due to their specific

              Peruvian human skeletons, revealing that a member of the M.
              tuberculosis complex caused human disease before contact. The
              ancient strains are distinct from known human-adapted forms and
              are most closely related to those adapted to seals and sea lions.
              Two independent dating approaches suggest a most recent common
              ancestor for the M. tuberculosis complex less than 6,000 years
              ago, which supports a Holocene dispersal of the disease. Our

              understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral
              microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from
              humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to
              present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as
              New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core
              microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been
              maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these
              microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting
              that they have been important oral members since before the

              structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely

              differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100

  abstract = "Fifty years ago, David Baltimore published a brief conceptual
              paper delineating the classification of viruses by the routes of
              genome expression. The six ``Baltimore classes'' of viruses, with
              a subsequently added 7th class, became the conceptual framework
              for the development of virology during the next five decades.
              During this time, it became clear that the Baltimore classes,
              with relatively minor additions, indeed cover the diversity of
              virus genome expression schemes that also define the replication
              cycles. Here, we examine the status of the Baltimore classes 50
              years after their advent and explore their links with the global
              ecology and biology of the respective viruses. We discuss an
              extension of the Baltimore scheme and why many logically
              admissible expression-replication schemes do not appear to be
              realized in nature. Recent phylogenomic analyses allow tracing
              the complex connections between the Baltimore classes and the
              monophyletic realms of viruses. The five classes of RNA viruses
              and reverse-transcribing viruses share an origin, whereas both
              the single-stranded DNA viruses and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
              viruses evolved on multiple independent occasions. Most of the
              Baltimore classes of viruses probably emerged during the earliest
              era of life evolution, at the stage of the primordial pool of
              diverse replicators, and before the advent of modern-like cells
              with large dsDNA genomes. The Baltimore classes remain an
              integral part of the conceptual foundation of biology, providing
              the essential structure for the logical space of information

  abstract = "The genome architecture of bacteria and eukaryotes evolves in
              opposite directions when subject to genetic drift, a difference
              that can be ascribed to the fact that bacteria exhibit a
              mutational bias that deletes superfluous sequences, whereas
              eukaryotes are biased toward large insertions. Expansion of
              eukaryotic genomes occurs through the addition of non-functional
              sequences, such as repetitive sequences and transposable
              elements, whereas variation in bacterial genome size is largely
              due to the acquisition and loss of functional accessory genes.
              These properties create the situation in which eukaryotes with
              very similar numbers of genes can have vastly different genome
              sizes, while in bacteria, gene number scales linearly with genome
              size. Some bacterial genomes, however, particularly those of
              species that undergo bottlenecks due to recent association with
              hosts, accumulate pseudogenes and mobile elements, conferring
              them a low gene content relative to their genome size. These
              non-functional sequences are gradually eroded and eliminated
              after long-term association with hosts, with the result that
              obligate symbionts have the smallest genomes of any cellular
              organism. The architecture of bacterial genomes is shaped by
              complex and diverse processes, but for most bacterial species,
              genome size is governed by a non-adaptive process, i.e., genetic
              drift coupled with a mutational bias toward deletions. Thus,
              bacteria with small effective population sizes typically have the
              smallest genomes. Some marine bacteria counter this
              near-universal trend: despite having immense population sizes,
              selection, not drift, acts to reduce genome size in response to
              metabolic constraints in their nutrient-limited environment.",

              thoughts about the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic
              cells. More than 20 different versions of endosymbiotic theory
              have been presented in the literature to explain the origin of
              eukaryotes and their mitochondria. Very few of those models
              account for eukaryotic anaerobes. The role of energy and the
              energetic constraints that prokaryotic cell organization placed
              on evolutionary innovation in cell history has recently come to
              bear on endosymbiotic theory. Only cells that possessed

              complexity, which is why there are no true intermediates in the
              prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Current versions of

              prominent constituents of prokaryotic genomes. Many plasmids are
              found in their host cell in multiple copies. This leads to an
              increased mutational supply of plasmid-encoded genes and
              genetically heterogeneous plasmid genomes. Nonetheless, the
              segregation of plasmid copies into daughter cells during cell
              division is considered to occur in the absence of selection on
              the plasmid alleles. We investigate the implications of random
              genetic drift of multicopy plasmids during cell division-termed
              here ``segregational drift''-to plasmid evolution. Performing
              experimental evolution of low- and high-copy non-mobile plasmids
              in Escherichia coli, we find that the evolutionary rate of
              multicopy plasmids does not reflect the increased mutational
              supply expected according to their copy number. In addition,
              simulated evolution of multicopy plasmid alleles demonstrates
              that segregational drift leads to increased loss frequency and
              extended fixation time of plasmid mutations in comparison to

              demonstrates that segregational drift of multicopy plasmids
              interferes with the retention and fixation of novel plasmid
              variants. Depending on the selection pressure on newly emerging
              variants, plasmid genomes may evolve slower than haploid
              chromosomes, regardless of their higher mutational supply. We
              suggest that plasmid copy number is an important determinant of

  abstract = "Genome size in mammals and birds shows remarkably little
              interspecific variation compared with other taxa. However, genome
              sequencing has revealed that many mammal and bird lineages have
              experienced differential rates of transposable element (TE)
              accumulation, which would be predicted to cause substantial
              variation in genome size between species. Thus, we hypothesize
              that there has been covariation between the amount of DNA gained
              by transposition and lost by deletion during mammal and avian
              evolution, resulting in genome size equilibrium. To test this
              model, we develop computational methods to quantify the amount of
              DNA gained by TE expansion and lost by deletion over the last 100
              My in the lineages of 10 species of eutherian mammals and 24
              species of birds. The results reveal extensive variation in the
              amount of DNA gained via lineage-specific transposition, but that
              DNA loss counteracted this expansion to various extents across
              lineages. Our analysis of the rate and size spectrum of deletion
              events implies that DNA removal in both mammals and birds has
              proceeded mostly through large segmental deletions (>10 kb).
              These findings support a unified ``accordion'' model of genome
              size evolution in eukaryotes whereby DNA loss counteracting TE
              expansion is a major determinant of genome size. Furthermore, we
              propose that extensive DNA loss, and not necessarily a dearth of
              TE activity, has been the primary force maintaining the greater
              genomic compaction of flying birds and bats relative to their

              obesity through continual DNA bloating, recent research supports
              that most plants activity purge DNA. Plant genome size research
              has greatly benefited from the cataloguing of genome size
              estimates at the Kew Plant DNA C-values Database, and the recent
              availability of over 50 fully sequenced and published plant
              genomes. The emerging trend is that plant genomes bloat due to
              the copy-and-paste proliferation of a few long terminal repeat
              retrotransposons (LTRs) and aggressively purge these
              proliferating LTRs through several mechanisms including
              illegitimate and incomplete recombination, and double-strand
              break repair through non-homologous end joining. However,
              ultra-small genomes such as Utricularia gibba (Bladderwort),
              which is 82 megabases (Mb), purge excess DNA through genome
              fractionation and neofunctionalization during multiple rounds of
              whole genome duplication (WGD). In contrast, the largest
              published genome, Picea abies (Norway Spruce) at 19 800 Mb, has
              no detectable WGD but has bloated with diverse and diverged LTRs
              that either have evaded purging mechanisms or these purging
              mechanism are absent in gymnosperms. Finally, advances in DNA
              methylation studies suggest that smaller genomes have a more
              aggressive epigenomic surveillance system to purge young LTR
              retrotransposons, which is less active or missing in larger
              genomes like the bloated gymnosperms. While genome size may not

              Discovery of examples of genome dynamism is accelerating as
              genome sequences are completed from diverse eukaryotes. Though
              much is known about genomes in animals, fungi, and plants, these
              lineages represent only 3 of the 60-200 lineages of eukaryotes.
              Here, we discuss diverse genomic strategies in exemplar
              eukaryotic lineages, including numerous microbial eukaryotes, to
              reveal dramatic variation that challenges established views of
              genome evolution. For example, in the life cycle of some members
              of the ``radiolaria,'' ploidy increases from haploid (N) to
              approximately 1,000N, whereas intrapopulation variability of the
              enteric parasite Entamoeba ranges from 4N to 40N. Variation has
              also been found within our own species, with substantial
              differences in both gene content and chromosome lengths between
              individuals. Data on the dynamic nature of genomes shift the
              perception of the genome from being fixed and characteristic of a

              caused by Mycobacterium leprae, but a small number of cases are
              now known to be caused by Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a sister
              taxon of M. leprae. The global pattern of genomic variation in M.

              being sequenced, such as the presence of blunt ends,
              single-stranded overhangs, or single-strand breaks. We here
              describe MatchSeq, a method that combines single-stranded DNA
              library preparation from diluted DNA samples with computational
              sequence matching, allowing the reconstruction of double-stranded
              DNA fragments on a single-molecule level. The application of
              MatchSeq to Neanderthal DNA, a particularly complex source of
              degraded DNA, reveals that 1- or 2-nt overhangs and blunt ends
              dominate the ends of ancient DNA molecules and that short gaps
              exist, which are predominantly caused by the loss of individual
              purines. We further show that deamination of cytosine to uracil
              occurs in both single- and double-stranded contexts close to the
              ends of molecules, and that single-stranded parts of DNA

              samples for sequencing have hitherto made it impossible to
              determine the precise structure of double-stranded DNA fragments
              being sequenced, such as the presence of blunt ends,
              single-stranded overhangs, or single-strand breaks. We here
              describe MatchSeq, a method that combines single-stranded DNA
              library preparation from diluted DNA samples with computational
              sequence matching, allowing the reconstruction of double-stranded
              DNA fragments on a single-molecule level. The application of
              MatchSeq to Neanderthal DNA, a particularly complex source of
              degraded DNA, reveals that 1- or 2-nt overhangs and blunt ends
              dominate the ends of ancient DNA molecules and that short gaps
              exist, which are predominantly caused by the loss of individual
              purines. We further show that deamination of cytosine to uracil
              occurs in both single- and double-stranded contexts close to the
              ends of molecules, and that single-stranded parts of DNA
              fragments are enriched in pyrimidines. MatchSeq provides
              unprecedented resolution for interrogating the structures of
              fragmented double-stranded DNA and can be applied to fragmented
              double-stranded DNA isolated from any biological source. The

              easily be integrated into routine data generation. This

              molecules containing T.C or C.C mispairs in the lacZ
              alpha-complementation gene results in deamination of cytosine to
              uracil, producing T.U or C.U mispairs. Strands which have
              undergone deamination at the target site to produce uracil will
              yield dark blue plaque revertants, while all other strands yield
              faint blue or colorless plaque phenotypes upon transfection of an
              ung- alpha-complementation Escherichia coli host strain. Rate
              constants were calculated from the reversion frequencies for
              several different heteroduplexes incubated at either 60 or 37
              degrees C. For the 60 degrees C incubations, the hydrolytic
              deamination rate constants for mispairs in three different local
              sequence environments ranged from 8 x 10(-10) to 40 x 10(-10)
              s-1. For incubations at 37 degrees C, the rate constants were
              between 0.4 x 10(-10) and 1.3 x 10(-10) sec-1. At both
              temperatures and for all mispairs, these rate constants are
              significantly greater than deamination rate constants in properly
              matched Watson-Crick G.C base pairs and are similar to those
              constants determined for cytosine deamination in single-stranded
              DNA. Since deamination most likely occurs via a single-stranded
              intermediate, the data suggest that, at 37 degrees C, the T.C and
              C.C mispairs exhibit from 20\% to 100\% single-stranded
              character. We conclude that cytosine residues involved in a
              mispair in DNA are 1-2 orders of magnitude more prone to
              deaminate to uracil than are cytosines in double-stranded

              fossil humans has led to calls for further tests to be carried
              out on similar material. However, there has been little
              systematic research on the survival of DNA in the fossil record,
              even though the environment of the fossil is known to be of
              paramount importance for the survival of biomolecules over

              of aDNA survival would enable research to focus on material with
              greater chances of successful amplification, thus preventing the
              unnecessary loss of material and valuable researcher time. We
              argue that the thermal history of a fossil is a key parameter for
              the survival of biomolecules. The thermal history of a number of
              northwest European Neanderthal cave sites is reconstructed here
              and they are ranked in terms of the relative likelihood of aDNA
              survival at the sites, under the assumption that DNA depurination
              is the principal mechanism of degradation. The claims of aDNA
              amplification from material found at Lake Mungo, Australia, are
              also considered in the light of the thermal history of this site.",

              emissions through the northward expansion of wetlands.
              Intriguingly, we discover a remarkable sequence similarity
              (>98\%) between pioneer methanogens and present-day thawing

  abstract = "Genome size in mammals and birds shows remarkably little
              interspecific variation compared with other taxa. However, genome
              sequencing has revealed that many mammal and bird lineages have
              experienced differential rates of transposable element (TE)
              accumulation, which would be predicted to cause substantial
              variation in genome size between species. Thus, we hypothesize
              that there has been covariation between the amount of DNA gained
              by transposition and lost by deletion during mammal and avian
              evolution, resulting in genome size equilibrium. To test this
              model, we develop computational methods to quantify the amount of
              DNA gained by TE expansion and lost by deletion over the last 100
              My in the lineages of 10 species of eutherian mammals and 24
              species of birds. The results reveal extensive variation in the
              amount of DNA gained via lineage-specific transposition, but that
              DNA loss counteracted this expansion to various extents across
              lineages. Our analysis of the rate and size spectrum of deletion
              events implies that DNA removal in both mammals and birds has
              proceeded mostly through large segmental deletions (>10 kb).
              These findings support a unified ``accordion'' model of genome
              size evolution in eukaryotes whereby DNA loss counteracting TE
              expansion is a major determinant of genome size. Furthermore, we
              propose that extensive DNA loss, and not necessarily a dearth of
              TE activity, has been the primary force maintaining the greater

              resulting in short DNA fragments. Advances in laboratory methods
              have made it possible to retrieve short DNA fragments, thereby
              improving access to DNA preserved in highly degraded, ancient
              material. However, such material contains large amounts of
              microbial contamination in addition to DNA fragments from the
              ancient organism. The resulting mixture of sequences constitutes
              a challenge for computational analysis, since microbial sequences
              are hard to distinguish from the ancient sequences of interest,
              especially when they are short. RESULTS: Here, we develop a
              method to quantify spurious alignments based on the presence or
              absence of rare variants. We find that spurious alignments are
              enriched for mismatches and insertion/deletion differences and
              lack substitution patterns typical of ancient DNA. The impact of
              spurious alignments can be reduced by filtering on these features
              and by imposing a sample-specific minimum length cutoff. We apply
              this approach to sequences from four ~ 430,000-year-old Sima de
              los Huesos hominin remains, which contain particularly short DNA
              fragments, and increase the amount of usable sequence data by
              17-150\%. This allows us to place a third specimen from the site

              Discovery of examples of genome dynamism is accelerating as
              genome sequences are completed from diverse eukaryotes. Though
              much is known about genomes in animals, fungi, and plants, these

              about terrestrial subsurface microbiomes is almost exclusively
              derived from groundwater and porous sediments mainly by using 16S
              rRNA gene surveys. To obtain more insights about biomass of
              consolidated rocks and the metabolic status of endolithic
              microbiomes, we investigated interbedded limestone and mudstone
              from the vadose zone, fractured aquifers, and deep aquitards.
              RESULTS: By adapting methods from microbial archaeology and
              paleogenomics, we could recover sufficient DNA for downstream
              metagenomic analysis from seven rock specimens independent of
              porosity, lithology, and depth. Based on the extracted DNA, we
              estimated between 2.81 and 4.25 $\times$ 105 cells $\times$ g-1
              rock. Analyzing DNA damage patterns revealed paleome signatures
              (genetic records of past microbial communities) for three rock
              specimens, all obtained from the vadose zone. DNA obtained from
              deep aquitards isolated from surface input was not affected by
              DNA decay indicating that water saturation and not flow is
              controlling subsurface microbial survival. Decoding the taxonomy
              and functional potential of paleome communities revealed
              increased abundances for sequences affiliated with
              chemolithoautotrophs and taxa such as Cand. Rokubacteria. We also

              sedimentary organic matter in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Our study

              environmental stress at modern times, due to their specific

  abstract = "Plant genome size variation is a dynamic process of bloating and
              purging DNA. While it was thought plants were on a path to
              obesity through continual DNA bloating, recent research supports
              that most plants activity purge DNA. Plant genome size research
              has greatly benefited from the cataloguing of genome size
              estimates at the Kew Plant DNA C-values Database, and the recent
              availability of over 50 fully sequenced and published plant
              genomes. The emerging trend is that plant genomes bloat due to
              the copy-and-paste proliferation of a few long terminal repeat
              retrotransposons (LTRs) and aggressively purge these
              proliferating LTRs through several mechanisms including
              illegitimate and incomplete recombination, and double-strand
              break repair through non-homologous end joining. However,
              ultra-small genomes such as Utricularia gibba (Bladderwort),
              which is 82 megabases (Mb), purge excess DNA through genome
              fractionation and neofunctionalization during multiple rounds of
              whole genome duplication (WGD). In contrast, the largest
              published genome, Picea abies (Norway Spruce) at 19 800 Mb, has
              no detectable WGD but has bloated with diverse and diverged LTRs
              that either have evaded purging mechanisms or these purging
              mechanism are absent in gymnosperms. Finally, advances in DNA
              methylation studies suggest that smaller genomes have a more
              aggressive epigenomic surveillance system to purge young LTR
              retrotransposons, which is less active or missing in larger
              genomes like the bloated gymnosperms. While genome size may not
              reflect genome complexity, evidence is mounting that genome size
              may reflect evolutionary status.",

              nucleotide positions within the human hypervariable region 1
              (HVR1) and cytochrome oxidase subunit III genes. A comparison of
              damaged sites within and between the regions reveals that damage
              hotspots exist and that, in the HVR1, these correlate with sites
              known to have high in vivo mutation rates. Conversely, HVR1
              subregions with known structural function, such as MT5, have
              lower in vivo mutation rates and lower postmortem-damage rates.
              The postmortem data also identify a possible functional subregion

              protocols using double-stranded DNA derived from FFPE material we
              obtain on average 900-fold more library molecules and improved
              sequence complexity from as little as 5 ng input DNA. FFPE DNA is
              highly fragmented, usually below 100bp, and up to 60\% of reads
              start after or end prior to adenine residues, suggesting that
              crosslinks predominate at adenine residues. Similar to ancient

              exhibit different chemical characteristics, with the former
              showing depurination and cytosine deamination by-products,
              resulting from post-mortem DNA damage. Such chemical
              modifications can interfere with the molecular tools used for
              building second-generation DNA libraries, and limit our ability
              to fully characterize the true complexity of ancient DNA
              extracts. In this study, we first use fresh DNA extracts to
              demonstrate that library preparation based on adapter ligation at
              AT-overhangs are biased against DNA templates starting with
              thymine residues, contrarily to blunt-end adapter ligation. We
              observe the same bias on fresh DNA extracts sheared on Bioruptor,
              Covaris and nebulizers. This contradicts previous reports
              suggesting that this bias could originate from the methods used
              for shearing DNA. This also suggests that AT-overhang adapter
              ligation efficiency is affected in a sequence-dependent manner
              and results in an uneven representation of different genomic
              contexts. We then show how this bias could affect the base
              composition of ancient DNA libraries prepared following
              AT-overhang ligation, mainly by limiting the ability to ligate
              DNA templates starting with thymines and therefore deaminated
              cytosines. This results in particular nucleotide misincorporation
              damage patterns, deviating from the signature generally expected
              for authenticating ancient sequence data. Consequently, we show
              that models adequate for estimating post-mortem DNA damage levels

              typically approximately 16 kb in size. With few exceptions, all
              animal mitochondrial genomes contain the same 37 genes: two for
              rRNAs, 13 for proteins and 22 for tRNAs. The products of these
              genes, along with RNAs and proteins imported from the cytoplasm,
              endow mitochondria with their own systems for DNA replication,
              transcription, mRNA processing and translation of proteins. The
              study of these genomes as they function in mitochondrial
              systems-'mitochondrial genomics'-serves as a model for genome

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Ancient DNA (aDNA) molecules in fossilized bones and
              teeth, coprolites, sediments, mummified specimens and museum
              collections represent fantastic sources of information for
              evolutionary biologists, revealing the agents of past epidemics
              and the dynamics of past populations. However, the analysis of
              aDNA generally faces two major issues. Firstly, sequences consist
              of a mixture of endogenous and various exogenous backgrounds,
              mostly microbial. Secondly, high nucleotide misincorporation
              rates can be observed as a result of severe post-mortem DNA
              damage. Such misincorporation patterns are instrumental to
              authenticate ancient sequences versus modern contaminants. We
              recently developed the user-friendly mapDamage package that
              identifies such patterns from next-generation sequencing (NGS)
              sequence datasets. The absence of formal statistical modeling of
              the DNA damage process, however, precluded rigorous quantitative
              comparisons across samples. RESULTS: Here, we describe mapDamage
              2.0 that extends the original features of mapDamage by
              incorporating a statistical model of DNA damage. Assuming that
              damage events depend only on sequencing position and post-mortem
              deamination, our Bayesian statistical framework provides
              estimates of four key features of aDNA molecules: the average
              length of overhangs ($\lambda$), nick frequency ($\nu$) and
              cytosine deamination rates in both double-stranded regions ( )
              and overhangs ( ). Our model enables rescaling base quality
              scores according to their probability of being damaged. mapDamage
              2.0 handles NGS datasets with ease and is compatible with a wide
              range of DNA library protocols. AVAILABILITY: mapDamage 2.0 is
              available at ginolhac.github.io/mapDamage/ as a Python package

              or SCR, uses directional splinted ligation of Illumina's P5 and
              P7 adapters to convert natively single-stranded DNA and heat
              denatured double-stranded DNA into sequencing libraries in a
              single enzymatic reaction. To demonstrate its efficacy in
              converting degraded DNA molecules, we prepare 5 ancient DNA
              extracts into sequencing libraries using the SCR and 2 of the
              most commonly used approaches for preparing degraded DNA for
              sequencing: BEST, which targets and converts double-stranded DNA,
              and ssDNA2.0, which targets and converts single-stranded DNA. We
              then compare the efficiency with which each approach recovers
              unique molecules, or library complexity, given a standard amount

              BEST protocol in recovering unique molecules and, despite its
              relative simplicity to perform and low cost per library, has
              similar performance to ssDNA2.0 across a wide range of DNA

              time series that stretch well back into the Early Pleistocene
              subepoch. Although theoretical models suggest that DNA should
              survive on this timescale1, the oldest genomic data recovered so
              far are from a horse specimen dated to 780-560 thousand years

              subepochs, two of which are more than one million years old. We
              find that two distinct mammoth lineages were present in eastern

              rise to the woolly mammoth and the other represents a previously
              unrecognized lineage that was ancestral to the first mammoths to
              colonize North America. Our analyses reveal that the Columbian
              mammoth of North America traces its ancestry to a Middle
              Pleistocene hybridization between these two lineages, with
              roughly equal admixture proportions. Finally, we show that the

              repeat structure of a large number of genomes. The analysis gives
              an upper-bound on the performance of genome assemblers for de
              novo reconstruction of genomes across a wide range of read
              lengths. Further, we demonstrate that the majority of genes in

              short reads even if the genomes themselves cannot. The
              non-reconstructible genes are overwhelmingly related to mobile

              ancient samples are often burdened with environmental

              mixtures of ancient and modern DNA. The ability to rapidly and
              reliably establish the authenticity and integrity of ancient
              samples is essential for ancient DNA studies, and the ability to
              distinguish between ancient and modern sequences is particularly
              important for ancient microbiome studies. Characteristic patterns
              of ancient DNA damage, namely DNA fragmentation and cytosine
              deamination (observed as C-to-T transitions) are typically used
              to authenticate ancient samples and sequences, but existing tools

  abstract = "Fifty years ago, David Baltimore published a brief conceptual
              paper delineating the classification of viruses by the routes of
              genome expression. The six ``Baltimore classes'' of viruses, with
              a subsequently added 7th class, became the conceptual framework
              for the development of virology during the next five decades.
              During this time, it became clear that the Baltimore classes,
              with relatively minor additions, indeed cover the diversity of
              virus genome expression schemes that also define the replication
              cycles. Here, we examine the status of the Baltimore classes 50
              years after their advent and explore their links with the global
              ecology and biology of the respective viruses. We discuss an
              extension of the Baltimore scheme and why many logically
              admissible expression-replication schemes do not appear to be
              realized in nature. Recent phylogenomic analyses allow tracing
              the complex connections between the Baltimore classes and the
              monophyletic realms of viruses. The five classes of RNA viruses
              and reverse-transcribing viruses share an origin, whereas both
              the single-stranded DNA viruses and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
              viruses evolved on multiple independent occasions. Most of the
              Baltimore classes of viruses probably emerged during the earliest
              era of life evolution, at the stage of the primordial pool of
              diverse replicators, and before the advent of modern-like cells
              with large dsDNA genomes. The Baltimore classes remain an
              integral part of the conceptual foundation of biology, providing
              the essential structure for the logical space of information

  abstract = "Claims of extreme survival of DNA have emphasized the need for
              reliable models of DNA degradation through time. By analysing
              mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 158 radiocarbon-dated bones of the
              extinct New Zealand moa, we confirm empirically a
              long-hypothesized exponential decay relationship. The average DNA
              half-life within this geographically constrained fossil
              assemblage was estimated to be 521 years for a 242 bp mtDNA
              sequence, corresponding to a per nucleotide fragmentation rate
              (k) of 5.50 $\times$ 10(-6) per year. With an effective burial
              temperature of 13.1°C, the rate is almost 400 times slower than
              predicted from published kinetic data of in vitro DNA
              depurination at pH 5. Although best described by an exponential
              model (R(2) = 0.39), considerable sample-to-sample variance in
              DNA preservation could not be accounted for by geologic age. This
              variation likely derives from differences in taphonomy and bone
              diagenesis, which have confounded previous, less spatially
              constrained attempts to study DNA decay kinetics. Lastly, by
              calculating DNA fragmentation rates on Illumina HiSeq data, we
              show that nuclear DNA has degraded at least twice as fast as
              mtDNA. These results provide a baseline for predicting long-term

              extends for 6.27 Gigabase pairs (Gbp), is 205.00 cm (cm) long and
              weighs 6.41 picograms (pg). Female values are 6.37 Gbp, 208.23

  author   = "Bobay, Louis-Marie and Ochman, Howard",
  abstract = "The genome architecture of bacteria and eukaryotes evolves in
              opposite directions when subject to genetic drift, a difference
              that can be ascribed to the fact that bacteria exhibit a
              mutational bias that deletes superfluous sequences, whereas
              eukaryotes are biased toward large insertions. Expansion of
              eukaryotic genomes occurs through the addition of non-functional
              sequences, such as repetitive sequences and transposable
              elements, whereas variation in bacterial genome size is largely
              due to the acquisition and loss of functional accessory genes.
              These properties create the situation in which eukaryotes with
              very similar numbers of genes can have vastly different genome
              sizes, while in bacteria, gene number scales linearly with genome
              size. Some bacterial genomes, however, particularly those of
              species that undergo bottlenecks due to recent association with
              hosts, accumulate pseudogenes and mobile elements, conferring
              them a low gene content relative to their genome size. These
              non-functional sequences are gradually eroded and eliminated
              after long-term association with hosts, with the result that
              obligate symbionts have the smallest genomes of any cellular
              organism. The architecture of bacterial genomes is shaped by
              complex and diverse processes, but for most bacterial species,
              genome size is governed by a non-adaptive process, i.e., genetic
              drift coupled with a mutational bias toward deletions. Thus,
              bacteria with small effective population sizes typically have the
              smallest genomes. Some marine bacteria counter this
              near-universal trend: despite having immense population sizes,
              selection, not drift, acts to reduce genome size in response to
              metabolic constraints in their nutrient-limited environment.",

  abstract = "The rate of deamination of cytosine in mismatched base pairs has
              been determined. Incubation of M13mp2 nicked heteroduplex DNA
              molecules containing T.C or C.C mispairs in the lacZ
              alpha-complementation gene results in deamination of cytosine to
              uracil, producing T.U or C.U mispairs. Strands which have
              undergone deamination at the target site to produce uracil will
              yield dark blue plaque revertants, while all other strands yield
              faint blue or colorless plaque phenotypes upon transfection of an
              ung- alpha-complementation Escherichia coli host strain. Rate
              constants were calculated from the reversion frequencies for
              several different heteroduplexes incubated at either 60 or 37
              degrees C. For the 60 degrees C incubations, the hydrolytic
              deamination rate constants for mispairs in three different local
              sequence environments ranged from 8 x 10(-10) to 40 x 10(-10)
              s-1. For incubations at 37 degrees C, the rate constants were
              between 0.4 x 10(-10) and 1.3 x 10(-10) sec-1. At both
              temperatures and for all mispairs, these rate constants are
              significantly greater than deamination rate constants in properly
              matched Watson-Crick G.C base pairs and are similar to those
              constants determined for cytosine deamination in single-stranded
              DNA. Since deamination most likely occurs via a single-stranded
              intermediate, the data suggest that, at 37 degrees C, the T.C and
              C.C mispairs exhibit from 20\% to 100\% single-stranded
              character. We conclude that cytosine residues involved in a
              mispair in DNA are 1-2 orders of magnitude more prone to
              deaminate to uracil than are cytosines in double-stranded
              DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

              through a metataxonomic approach involving targeted amplification
              of one or more variable regions in the 16S rRNA gene.
              Specifically, the V3 region (E. coli 341-534) of this gene has
              been suggested as an excellent candidate for ancient DNA
              amplification and microbial community reconstruction. However, in
              practice this metataxonomic approach often produces highly skewed
              taxonomic frequency data. In this study, we use non-targeted
              (shotgun metagenomics) sequencing methods to better understand
              skewed microbial profiles observed in four ancient dental
              calculus specimens previously analyzed by amplicon sequencing.
              Through comparisons of microbial taxonomic counts from paired

              microbiome taxonomic profiles from 16S rRNA V3 amplicon data
              generated using universal primers. Because in silico analysis
              indicates that alternative 16S rRNA hypervariable regions will
              present similar challenges, we advocate for the use of a shotgun

              variation, or evolution of this microbial community. To better
              understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral
              microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from
              humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to
              present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as
              New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core
              microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been
              maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these
              microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting
              that they have been important oral members since before the
              catarrhine-platyrrhine split ca. 40 Mya. However, community
              structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely
              reflect host relationships, and the dental biofilms of Homo and
              chimpanzees are distinguished by major taxonomic and functional
              differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100
              thousand years ago, we show that the microbial profiles of both
              Neanderthals and modern humans are highly similar, sharing
              functional adaptations in nutrient metabolism. These include an
              apparent Homo-specific acquisition of salivary amylase-binding

              China. They were suggested to be used for storage of liquid
              foods, for example gruel, ephedra soup or milk, however this
              notion has not been supported by analytical facts. We applied
              comprehensive multi-technique analytical approach, including
              FT-IR, proteomics, GC--MS and starch grains analyses to
              characterize minute amount of dried organic film preserved on the
              inner surface of one of the Gumugou grass woven baskets. The
              analysis revealed the presence of Bovidae milk proteins and
              traces of lactic acid bacteria. Together with the relative
              abundance of detected caseins and whey proteins it suggested that
              the organic deposit in the woven basket was strained sour milk.
              No ephedra biomarkers or starch grains were found. The protein
              composition of Gumugou sample differed from solid dairy products
              recently discovered at the nearby Xiaohe Cemetery. We speculate
              that the alterations in local dairy technologies might be the
              result of two processes: climatic changes in the region of Tarim
              basin and admix of early European settlers with
              lactose-intolerant Eastern ethnic group. European ancestry of
              Gumugou inhabitants suggested that the milking practice in the
              Tarim region was promoted by the eastward migration of European
              population which was predominantly lactose--persistent. Xiaohe
              site (3600 BP) was inhabited by a West-East admixed community for
              whom solid dairy products became a dietary requirement that

              cementum (p = 0.001). This difference, however, is driven largely

              Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial
              genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human
              palaeofaeces samples (1,000-2,000 years old) with well-preserved

              oligodeoxyribonucleotides of varying lengths and containing
              uracil residue(s) in various locations. The results show that the
              Escherichia coli enzyme can remove a 5'-terminal U from an
              oligomer only if the 5'-end is phosphorylated. The enzyme does
              not remove U residues from a 3'-terminal position, but U residues
              can be excised from oligonucleotides with either pd(UN)p or
              pd(UNN) 3'-termini. The oligomer d(UUUUT) can have the second or
              third U residues from the 5'-end excised even when the

              removed by a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) that initiates the base
              excision repair pathway. The major UDGs are mitochondrial UNG1
              and nuclear UNG2 encoded by the UNG-gene, and nuclear SMUG1. TDG
              and MBD4 remove uracil from special sequence contexts, but their
              roles remain poorly understood. UNG2 is cell cycle regulated and
              has a major role in post-replicative removal of incorporated
              uracils. UNG2 and SMUG1 are both important for prevention of
              mutations caused by cytosine deamination, and their functions are
              non-redundant. In addition, SMUG1 has a major role in removal of
              hydroxymethyl uracil from oxidized thymines. Furthermore,
              UNG-proteins and SMUG1 may have important functions in removal of
              oxidized cytosines, e.g. isodialuric acid, alloxan and
              5-hydroxyuracil after exposure to ionizing radiation. UNG2 is
              also essential in the acquired immune response, including somatic
              hypermutation (SHM) required for antibody affinity maturation and
              class switch recombination (CSR) mediating new effector
              functions, e.g. from IgM to IgG. Upon antigen exposure
              B-lymphocytes express activation induced cytosine deaminase that
              generates U:G mispairs at the Ig locus. These result in GC to AT
              transition mutations upon DNA replication and apparently other
              mutations as well. Some of these may result from the generation
              of abasic sites and translesion bypass synthesis across such
              sites. SMUG1 can not complement UNG2 deficiency, probably because
              it works very inefficiently on single-stranded DNA and is
              down-regulated in B cells. In humans, UNG-deficiency results in
              the hyper IgM syndrome characterized by recurrent infections,
              lymphoid hyperplasia, extremely low IgG, IgA and IgE and elevated
              IgM. Ung−/− mice have a similar phenotype, but in addition

              that segregational drift leads to increased loss frequency and
              extended fixation time of plasmid mutations in comparison to
              haploid chromosomes. Furthermore, an examination of the
              experimentally evolved hosts reveals a significant impact of the
              plasmid type on the host chromosome evolution. Our study
              demonstrates that segregational drift of multicopy plasmids
              interferes with the retention and fixation of novel plasmid
              variants. Depending on the selection pressure on newly emerging
              variants, plasmid genomes may evolve slower than haploid
              chromosomes, regardless of their higher mutational supply. We
              suggest that plasmid copy number is an important determinant of
              plasmid evolvability due to the manifestation of segregational
              drift.",

              can result in DNA template loss and sequencing biases, affecting

              preparation protocols, including two ``single-tube'' methods
              developed for this study with the explicit aim of improving data

              shown it afflicted human populations as far back as the
              Neolithic. Y. pestis genomes recovered from the Eurasian Late
              Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period have uncovered key
              evolutionary steps that led to its emergence from a Yersinia

              reconstructed LNBA genomes are too few to explore its diversity
              during this critical period of development. Here, we present 17
              Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide
              geographic expanse across Eurasia. This increased dataset enabled

              of archaeological material. Currently, the cochlea, part of the
              osseous inner ear located inside the petrous pyramid, is the most
              sought after skeletal element for molecular analyses of ancient
              humans as it has been shown to yield high amounts of endogenous
              DNA. However, destructive sampling of the petrous pyramid may not
              always be possible, particularly in cases where preservation of
              skeletal morphology is of top priority. To investigate
              alternatives, we present a survey of human aDNA preservation for
              each of ten skeletal elements in a skeletal collection from
              Medieval Germany. Through comparison of human DNA content and
              quality we confirm best performance of the petrous pyramid and
              identify seven additional sampling locations across four skeletal
              elements that yield adequate aDNA for most applications in human
              palaeogenetics. Our study provides a better perspective on DNA
              preservation across the human skeleton and takes a further step
              toward the more responsible use of ancient materials in human
              aDNA studies.",

              Ancient invasions by eubacteria through symbiosis more than a
              billion years ago initiated these processes. Advances in
              geochemistry, molecular phylogeny, and cell biology have offered
              insight into complex molecular events that drove the evolution of
              endosymbionts into contemporary organelles. In losing their
              autonomy, endosymbionts lost the bulk of their genomes,
              necessitating the evolution of elaborate mechanisms for organelle
              biogenesis and metabolite exchange. In the process, symbionts
              acquired many host-derived properties, lost much of their
              eubacterial identity, and were transformed into extraordinarily
              diverse organelles that reveal complex histories that we are only

              was extracted from this tissue in amounts approaching 1\% of that

              low molecular weight. Among the many clones obtained from the
              quagga DNA, two containing pieces of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
              were sequenced. These sequences, comprising 229 nucleotide pairs,
              differ by 12 base substitutions from the corresponding sequences
              of mtDNA from a mountain zebra, an extant member of the genus

              the quagga DNA sequences, and that the two species had a common

              timescales in diverse environments has led to a revolutionary
              body of paleogenomic research, yet the dynamics of DNA
              degradation are still poorly understood. We analyzed 185
              paleogenomic datasets and compared DNA survival with
              environmental variables and sample ages. We find cytosine
              deamination follows a conventional thermal age model, but we find
              no correlation between DNA fragmentation and sample age over the
              timespans analyzed, even when controlling for environmental
              variables. We propose a model for ancient DNA decay wherein
              fragmentation rapidly reaches a threshold, then subsequently
              slows. The observed loss of DNA over time may be due to a bulk
              diffusion process in many cases, highlighting the importance of
              tissues and environments creating effectively closed systems for
              DNA preservation. This model of DNA degradation is largely based
              on mammal bone samples due to published genomic dataset
              availability. Continued refinement to the model to reflect
              diverse biological systems and tissue types will further improve
