  abstract = {This study analyzes data sharing regarding mitochondrial, Y
              chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers
              on ancient human DNA published between 1988 and 2013. The
              estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6\% ± 2.1\%)
              and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic
              research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a
              questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals'
              editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be
              simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests.
              Most data were made available through body text, but the use of
              primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction
              of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods.
              Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results
              imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness
              and transparency for scientific progress may complement
              stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates.
              Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with
              a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability,
              accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the
              different ways in which data are released can be very useful to
              detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and
              understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of
              human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the
              importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable
              scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental
              challenges.},

              AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at

              that provide basic, standardised metadata and accession numbers to
              allow rapid data retrieval from online repositories. These tables

              longevity of the database. Internal guidelines and automated

              whole-genome resequencing. Starting with next-generation

              against reference genomes, PCR duplicate removal, characterization
              of and compensation for postmortem damage, SNP calling and
              maximum-likelihood phylogenomic inference, and it profiles the
