	abstract = {The field of phylogenetics has burgeoned into a great diversity of statistical models, providing researchers with a vast amount of analytical tools for investigating the evolutionary theory. This abundance of theoretical work has the merit that many different aspects of evolution can be investigated using various types of data. However, empiricists may sometimes struggle to find the right model for their needs amid such variety. In particular, some computer programs gather the theory of many different models, published in hundreds of different papers, within the same operational framework. This makes it particularly difficult for users to obtain comprehensive information about the assumptions and structure of various models. Yet, a large part of phylogenetic models are structured in individual modules that can be linked together in the same conceptual framework, akin to some sort of phylogenetic supermodel. In this paper, we propose to browse through the network of phylogenetic models, emphasizing their modular structure, with the purpose to outline the commonalities and differences of individual models. Focusing on probabilistic models, we describe how to go from the model assumptions to the corresponding probability distributions as pedagogically as possible. To achieve this task, we resort heavily on graph theory to represent the probabilistic relationships among parameters and data, and present the models in their most elementary form (i.e. including parameters that are generally marginalized out), which simplifies the mathematics considerably. We concentrate on models designed for species trees, but evoke the link with other types of trees (e.g. gene trees).},

	abstract = {The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software has matured to contain a large collection of methods and tools of computational molecular evolution. Here, we describe new additions that make MEGA a more comprehensive tool for building timetrees of species, pathogens, and gene families using rapid relaxed-clock methods. Methods for estimating divergence times and confidence intervals are implemented to use probability densities for calibration constraints for node-dating and sequence sampling dates for tip-dating analyses. They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery. Natively compiled graphical user interface and command-line versions of MEGA11 are available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS from www.megasoftware.net.},

	shorttitle = {Molecular {Evolution}},
	abstract = {Studies of evolution at the molecular level have experienced phenomenal growth in the last few decades, due to rapid accumulation of genetic sequence data, improved computer hardware and software, and the development of sophisticated analytical methods. The flood of genomic data has generated an acute need for powerful statistical methods and efficient computational algorithms to enable their effective analysis and interpretation. Molecular Evolution: a statistical approach presents and explains modern statistical methods and computational algorithms for the comparative analysis of genetic sequence data in the fields of molecular evolution, molecular phylogenetics, statistical phylogeography, and comparative genomics. Written by an expert in the field, the book emphasizes conceptual understanding rather than mathematical proofs. The text is enlivened with numerous examples of real data analysis and numerical calculations to illustrate the theory, in addition to the working problems at the end of each chapter. The coverage of maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are in particular up-to-date, comprehensive, and authoritative. This advanced textbook is aimed at graduate level students and professional researchers (both empiricists and theoreticians) in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology, statistical genomics, evolutionary biology, molecular systematics, and population genetics. It will also be of relevance and use to a wider audience of applied statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists working in computational biology.},
