               reproducibility to ensure robust analytical standards, and
               updating the pipeline to the latest routine ancient genomic
               practises. This new version of EAGER has been developed within
               the nf-core initiative to ensure high-quality software
               development and maintenance support; contributing to a long-term
               lifecycle for the pipeline. nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring
               that ancient DNA sequencing data can be used by a diverse range

               results from metagenomics experiments. With Pavian, researchers
               can analyze, visualize and transform results from various
               classifiers-such as Kraken, Centrifuge and MethaPhlAn-using
               interactive data tables, heatmaps and Sankey flow diagrams. An
               interactive alignment coverage viewer can help in the validation
               of matches to a particular genome, which can be crucial when
               using metagenomics experiments for pathogen detection.
               AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Pavian is implemented in the R
               language as a modular Shiny web app and is freely available under

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: A critical output of metagenomic studies is the
               estimation of abundances of taxonomical or functional groups. The
               inherent uncertainty in assignments to these groups makes it
               important to consider both their hierarchical contexts and their
               prediction confidence. The current tools for visualizing
               metagenomic data, however, omit or distort quantitative
               hierarchical relationships and lack the facility for displaying
               secondary variables. RESULTS: Here we present Krona, a new
               visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative
               abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of
               metagenomic classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial,
               space-filling displays with parametric coloring and interactive
               polar-coordinate zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation
               enables fully interactive charts that can be explored with any
               modern Web browser, without the need for installed software or
               plug-ins. This Web-based architecture also allows each chart to
               be an independent document, making them easy to share via e-mail
               or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate Krona's utility,
               we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and
               its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis tools.
               CONCLUSIONS: Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization
               tool and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly
               accessible bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive
               displays facilitate more informed interpretations of metagenomic
               analyses, while its implementation as a browser-based application
               makes it extremely portable and easily adopted into existing
               analysis packages. Both the Krona rendering code and conversion
               tools are freely available under a BSD open-source license, and
               available from: http://krona.sourceforge.net.},
